# Mi-Modal
### Simple Modal with HTML, CSS and JS 
You can add this to your HTML site by:
- Copying or creating the `<div class="mi-modal-cont">` element with `<div class="mi-modal">` as it's child
- You can either copy from the html file, the entire modal elements and tweak it to your taste or create your own, you just need the class `class="mi-modal-cont"` and `class="mi-modal"`
- Insert the stylesheet in the head tag `<link rel="stylesheet" href="mimodal.css">`
- Insert the script just before the end of the body tag `<script src="mimodal.js">`
- Your trigger button should have an id of `mi-modal-btn`
